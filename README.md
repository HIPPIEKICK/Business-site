This is my third project for Technigo.
My first time making forms, using Javascript and adding a hero image. I'm proud that I managed to include two things in my first function (not only toggle, but also to change the buttons innerHTML). It took some tries :)


# Short description of task: Build a Business Site

This weekâ€™s project is to create a site for a company of your choice. You can come up with your own fantasy company or use an excitsting one.

We want you to practise what we've gone through this week so the website should contain these three parts:

| hero image/video | signup form | accordion |
|---------|---------|---------|
| <img src="https://github.com/Technigo/project-3/blob/master/hero-video.png" alt="hero-video" width="300"/> | <img src="https://github.com/Technigo/project-3/blob/master/sign-up.png" alt="signup-form" width="300"/> | <img src="https://github.com/Technigo/project-3/blob/master/FAQ-design.png" alt="FAQ-accordion" width="300"/> |
